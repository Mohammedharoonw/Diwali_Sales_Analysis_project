Project Overview

The main objective of the Diwali Sales Analysis project is to analyze sales data and extract meaningful insights to support decision-making.

Project Learnings

Throughout the course of this project, the following key learnings were acquired:

Data Cleaning and Manipulation: The project involved cleaning and manipulating the raw sales data to ensure data integrity and reliability. This step included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA was performed using popular Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. This analysis involved generating descriptive statistics, visualizations, and identifying patterns or trends in the data. EDA provided valuable insights into the sales patterns, customer behavior, and overall performance during the Diwali season.

Customer Segmentation: The project focused on improving customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupations, genders, and age groups. By segmenting customers based on these factors, targeted marketing strategies can be developed to personalize offerings and increase customer satisfaction.

Product Analysis: To improve sales performance, the project identified the most selling product categories and individual products. This analysis enables businesses to plan their inventory effectively, ensuring that popular products are adequately stocked to meet customer demand during the Diwali season.
